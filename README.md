CIS-137-Homework-13

When this program is started, you will see 24 blue squares. You can click on a square to reveal a flower underneath. There are 12 pairs of flowers. Each time you start the program, the flowers will be in a different order.

There is a progress bar at the top. Each time you get a match, the progress bar will increase. The progress bar will be red for the first 50%, yellow until 80% completion, and green afterwards.
